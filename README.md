# Dynamic Programming
###### Dynamic Programming from other source 
>Dynamic Programming (commonly referred to as DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving a problem by recursively breaking it down into simpler subproblems and using the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to itâ€™s individual subproblems.

Go to the source of Dynamic Programming -> <https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/dynamic-programming/#:~:text=Dynamic%20Programming%20(commonly%20referred%20to,solution%20to%20it's%20individual%20subproblems.>

###### Dynamic Programming from CP-Algorithms 
```
int m, n;
vector<long long> dp_before(n), dp_cur(n);

long long C(int i, int j);

// compute dp_cur[l], ... dp_cur[r] (inclusive)
void compute(int l, int r, int optl, int optr) {
    if (l > r)
        return;

    int mid = (l + r) >> 1;
    pair<long long, int> best = {LLONG_MAX, -1};

    for (int k = optl; k <= min(mid, optr); k++) {
        best = min(best, {(k ? dp_before[k - 1] : 0) + C(k, mid), k});
    }

    dp_cur[mid] = best.first;
    int opt = best.second;

    compute(l, mid - 1, optl, opt);
    compute(mid + 1, r, opt, optr);
}

int solve() {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        dp_before[i] = C(0, i);

    for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        compute(0, n - 1, 0, n - 1);
        dp_before = dp_cur;
    }

    return dp_before[n - 1];
}
